Explanation of code from blackblox ai:
1) In the Parent component, we define a state variable dataFromChild and a function handleDataFromChild that updates this state.
2) We pass handleDataFromChild to the Child component as a prop named sendData.
3) In the Child component, when the button is clicked, we call sendData(data) to send the data back to the parent.


we will be doing the same but we will be updating a number from child component.
